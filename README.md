# Real Time Like Counter

Created a real time like counter to experiment with
Websockets in Spring. 

The frontent code is in
```aidl
src/main/resources/static
```

The backend code is in
```aidl
src/main/java/dev/naman/realtimeclap
```

To run the server (both frontend and backend), run
`RealTimeClapApplication.main()`
The server will run on http://localhost:8080/ . Check
console to see how Websocket is interacting with the
frontend.
